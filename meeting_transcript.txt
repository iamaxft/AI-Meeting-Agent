Project Phoenix - Weekly Sync

Attendees: Sarah (Project Manager), David (Lead Developer), Maria (UX Designer)

Sarah: Alright team, let's kick off the weekly sync for Project Phoenix. David, can you start with the development update?

David: Sure. The user authentication module is complete and fully tested. I've started work on the main dashboard component, but I've hit a small roadblock with the real-time chart library. It's not as straightforward as the documentation suggested. I think I'll need an extra day or two to figure it out.

Sarah: Okay, thanks for the heads-up. An extra two days is acceptable. Maria, what about the UX designs for the new settings page?

Maria: I've finished the high-fidelity mockups. They are ready for review. I've based them on the user feedback from last month's survey, focusing on simplicity. The main decision point is whether we go with a tabbed layout or a single, long-scrolling page. I've mocked up both.

Sarah: Great. Let's make a decision on that now. I prefer the tabbed layout. It feels more organized. David, any strong feelings?

David: No, the tabbed layout is fine by me. It's easier to implement too.

Sarah: Perfect. Decision made: we're going with the tabbed layout for the settings page. Maria, please finalize those designs and hand them over to David by the end of the day tomorrow.

David: Okay, once I get the designs from Maria, I can start building the frontend for that after I'm done with the dashboard charts.

Sarah: Excellent. So, to recap the action items: David, you will finish the dashboard chart integration by Wednesday. Maria, you will finalize the tabbed settings page designs and deliver them to David by end of day tomorrow. I will update the main project timeline with these new estimates. Anything else? No? Okay, great meeting everyone.
