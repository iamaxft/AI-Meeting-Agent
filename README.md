AI Meeting Agent & Automation Platform
This project is a full-stack SaaS application that automates the entire post-meeting workflow. It uses a Large Language Model (Google's Gemini) to analyze meeting transcripts, extracts structured data like summaries and action items, and then automates follow-up tasks by sending emails and creating cards in project management tools like Trello.

The application is built with a professional architecture, including a user and team management system, secure OAuth 2.0 integrations, and a background worker for persistent task monitoring, making it a powerful demonstration of modern AI and backend engineering skills.

Features
AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to perform several NLP tasks on raw meeting transcripts:

Concise Summaries: Generates a one-paragraph summary of the meeting.

Key Decision Tracking: Extracts a bulleted list of all concrete decisions made.

Action Item Extraction: Identifies tasks, assignees, and due dates.

Full User & Team System: Secure user registration and login, with the ability for users to create teams and invite members.

Seamless Integrations: Uses a secure, professional OAuth flow to connect to third-party services like Trello, eliminating the need for users to manually handle API keys.

Automated Workflow Engine:

Email Automation: Automatically sends formatted summary emails to all team members.

Task Management Automation: Automatically creates new cards in a user's selected Trello board and list for each action item.

AI Accountability Agent: A background worker (worker.py) runs on a schedule to monitor the status of created Trello cards, providing a foundation for automated follow-ups and reminders.

Interactive Web Interface: A clean, user-friendly dashboard built with Flask and Jinja2 that allows for transcript submission, automation control, and team management.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/iamaxft/AI-Meeting-Agent.git
cd AI-Meeting-Agent

2. Create a Virtual Environment
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure API Keys
Open the main_app.py and worker.py files and fill in your credentials in the CONFIGURATION section at the top:

GEMINI_API_KEY: Your key from Google AI Studio.

TRELLO_API_KEY & TRELLO_API_SECRET: Your Trello developer credentials.

SENDER_EMAIL & SENDER_PASSWORD: Your Gmail address and a 16-character Google App Password.

5. Set up Trello OAuth
Go to your Trello Power-Ups admin page and select your app.

In the "API key" tab, ensure the following are set:

Allowed origins: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Authorized redirect URIs: http://127.0.0.1:5000/trello/callback

Usage
The application requires two processes to be run simultaneously in separate terminals.

1. Run the Web Server
In your first terminal, run the main Flask application:

python main_app.py

This will start the web server. You can now go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to register, log in, and use the application.

2. Run the Background Worker
In your second terminal, run the accountability agent:

python worker.py

This worker will run in the background, checking on the status of Trello cards every minute (for testing).
